// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

//The correct oder is as follows
/*
Panning
Analysis of Requirements
Design
Implementation
Testing & Integration
Maintain
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const AnalysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, where the problem's root or the requirement for change can be addressed. Teams can take the project's or the solution's functional needs into account. In this step, end-user demands are examined to make sure the new system can live up to their demands."
const Design = "This is the third step, which involves discussing the essential requirements, functionalities, and actions that will fulfill the design criteria of the suggested system. End users should take this opportunity to discuss, identify, and examine the critical elements that the proposed system must have in order to achieve its goals."
const Implementation = "This is the fourth step, where the core of the program's code is written. In this step, the newly built systems are installed, putting the project into operation by transferring data and components from an old system to a new one."
const TestingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, which entails systems integration and system testing typically done by quality assurance engineers to see if the suggested design satisfies the initial set of business objective"
const Maintain = "This is the sixth step, which entails maintenance and ongoing upgrades. End users could perfect the system at this step if they want to enhance efficiency, add new features, or address more customer needss."
